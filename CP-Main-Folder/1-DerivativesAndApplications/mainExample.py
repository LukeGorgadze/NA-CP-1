# Idea 1:
# Medical Imaging: Derivatives are used in medical imaging to create high-resolution images of
# the body's internal structures. For example, radiologists can use
# derivatives to enhance the contrast between different types of tissues,
# which can help them diagnose and treat a variety of medical conditions.

# Idea 2:
# Weather Forecasting: Derivatives are used in weather forecasting to predict
# changes in atmospheric conditions. By analyzing the derivatives of temperature,
# pressure, and other weather variables over time,
# meteorologists can forecast the likelihood of storms, hurricanes, and other weather events.

# Idea 3:
# Predicting stock prices: Using synthetic financial data, we can use
# derivatives to predict stock prices based on historical trends,
# news articles, and other market indicators.

'''
One example of derivatives in real life is in the 
measurement of the rate of change of a physical 
quantity such as the speed and acceleration of a moving object. Let's 
consider an example of using derivatives to compute the 
speed of a moving object from its position measurements.

Suppose we have a series of position measurements taken 
at regular intervals, and we want to compute the 
corresponding velocities and accelerations. We can use finite differences 
to compute the derivative of the position with respect 
to time, which will give us an estimate of the velocity. 
Here's an example code in Python:'''


import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some sample data
t = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)
x = np.sin(t)

# Compute the velocity and acceleration using finite differences
v = np.diff(x) / np.diff(t)
a = np.diff(v) / np.diff(t[:-1])

# Plot the position, velocity and acceleration
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()

color = 'tab:red'
ax1.set_xlabel('Time (s)')
ax1.set_ylabel('Position', color=color)
ax1.plot(t, x, color=color)
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

ax2 = ax1.twinx()

color = 'tab:blue'
ax2.set_ylabel('Velocity / Acceleration', color=color)
ax2.plot(t[:-1], v, color=color, label='Velocity')
ax2.plot(t[:-2], a, color='green', label='Acceleration')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

fig.tight_layout()
plt.legend()
plt.show()
