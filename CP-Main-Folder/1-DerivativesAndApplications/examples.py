# Derivatives and their applications. (4 points)
# 1. Give three examples of derivativeâ€™s application.
# 2. Select one example, use finite differences or compact finite differences, code and visualize


# Idea 1:
# Medical Imaging: Derivatives are used in medical imaging to create high-resolution images of
# the body's internal structures. For example, radiologists can use
# derivatives to enhance the contrast between different types of tissues,
# which can help them diagnose and treat a variety of medical conditions.

# Idea 2:
# Weather Forecasting: Derivatives are used in weather forecasting to predict
# changes in atmospheric conditions. By analyzing the derivatives of temperature,
# pressure, and other weather variables over time,
# meteorologists can forecast the likelihood of storms, hurricanes, and other weather events.

# Idea 3:
# Predicting stock prices: Using synthetic financial data, we can use
# derivatives to predict stock prices based on historical trends,
# news articles, and other market indicators.

# My choice: Idea 2 - Example of basic weather forecasting
